Overview
========
The purpose of this demo is to show wakeup from deep sleep mode using MicroTick timer.
The demo sets the MicroTick Timer as a wake up source and puts the device in deep-sleep mode. 
The MicroTick timer wakes up the device. 
The code of this demo has been prepared and updated for use with the MCUXpresso Configuration Tools (Pins/Clocks/Peripherals).

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- Keil MDK  5.29

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso54S018M board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
1. Pin P3_12 is used as a CLKOUT signal. Connect this pin to an Oscilloscope for viewing the signal. 

Prepare the Demo
================

Running the demo
================
This demo is an external flash XIP demo, CPU will execute the code in external flash:
1. Build the demo to generate a bin file.
   Note: If need to generate bin file using MCUXpresso IDE, below steps need to be followed:
         Set in example Properties->C/C++ Build->Settings->Build steps->Post-build steps->Edit
         enbable arm-none-eabi-objcopy -v -O binary "&{BuildArtifactFileName}" "&{BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.bin" 
         
         This plainload example linked the vector table to 0x10000000, but program to external flash 0x10000000.

2. Program the bin file to external on board flash via SEGGER J-FLASH Lite(V6.22 or higher):

   a. Open SEGGER J-FLASH Lite, select device LPC54S018M.

   b. Click the 'Erase Chip' to erase the extrenal flash.(if can not success, press SW4 button and reset the board, and try to erase again)

   c. Select the bin data file, set the '.bin/Erase Start' address to 0x10000000, then click 'Program Device'
Note: Please use above way to program the binary file built by armgcc tool chain to external flash. 
      For IAR, KEIL, MCUXpresso IDE, you can use the IDE tool to program the external flash.  

3. Press the reset button.

The log below shows in the terminal window:

Utick wakeup demo start...
Wakeup from deep sleep mode...


The demo sets the MicroTick Timer as a wake up source and puts the device in deep-sleep mode. 
The MicroTick timer wakes up the device. After wake up the LED3 on the board blinks and a 
CLKOUT signal can be seen on pin P3_12.
The demo is not recommended to use debug mode In MCUXpresso, POWER_EnterDeepSleep () will 
kill the debug session.
