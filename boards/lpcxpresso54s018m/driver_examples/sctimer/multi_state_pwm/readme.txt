Overview
========
The SCTImer multi-state project is a demonstration program of the SCTimer state machine. It shows how to set up events to be triggered in a certain state
and transitioning between states.
State 0 has 2 events that generate a PWM signal, it also has an event linked to an input signal to transition to State 1.
State 1 has 4 events that generate 2 PWM signals, it also has an event linked to an input signal to transition to State 0.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso54S018M board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the LPC-Link USB port (J8) on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
This demo is an external flash plain load demo, ROM will copy image in external flash to SRAMX to run:
1. Build the demo to generate a bin file.
   Note: If need to generate bin file using MCUXpresso IDE, below steps need to be followed:
         Set in example Properties->C/C++ Build->Settings->Build steps->Post-build steps->Edit
         enbable arm-none-eabi-objcopy -v -O binary "&{BuildArtifactFileName}" "&{BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.bin" 
         
         This plainload example linked the vector table to 0x00000000, but program to external flash 0x10000000.

2. Program the bin file to external on board flash via SEGGER J-FLASH Lite(V6.22 or higher):

   a. Open SEGGER J-FLASH Lite, select device LPC54S018M.

   b. Click the 'Erase Chip' to erase the extrenal flash.(if can not success, press SW4 button and reset the board, and try to erase again)

   c. Select the bin data file, set the '.bin/Erase Start' address to 0x10000000, then click 'Program Device'
Note: Please use above way to program the binary file built by armgcc tool chain to external flash. 
      For IAR, KEIL, MCUXpresso IDE, you can use the IDE tool to program the external flash.  
The log below shows example output of the SCTimer multi-state demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCTimer example to output edge-aligned PWM signal

When user presses a switch the PWM signal will be seen from Out 2
When user presses the switch again PWM signal on Out 2 will turn off
The PWM signal from Out 4 will remain active all the time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use a Digital osc probe on J13_5(Out 4) and J13_16(Out 2) to watch the PWM.
- When press sw2 the PWM signal will be seen from J13_16.
- When press sw2 again the PWM signal will turn off from J13_16.
