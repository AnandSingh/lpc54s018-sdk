Overview
========
The SDIO project is a demonstration program that uses the SDK software. It reads/writes the SDIO card reigister. The purpose of this example is to show how to use SDio driver and this is a very simple example.
Note: If the sdio card need WL_REG_ON, please connect WL_REG_ON to the sdio card VDD pin for this example.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso54S018M board
- Personal Computer
- SDIO card(such as wifi card, we use ATHEROS AR6233X to test)

Board settings
==============
Insert the sdio card into card slot

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the LPC-Link USB port (J8) on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
This demo is an external flash plain load demo, ROM will copy image in external flash to SRAMX to run:
1. Build the demo to generate a bin file.
   Note: If need to generate bin file using MCUXpresso IDE, below steps need to be followed:
         Set in example Properties->C/C++ Build->Settings->Build steps->Post-build steps->Edit
         enbable arm-none-eabi-objcopy -v -O binary "&{BuildArtifactFileName}" "&{BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.bin" 
         
         This plainload example linked the vector table to 0x00000000, but program to external flash 0x10000000.

2. Program the bin file to external on board flash via SEGGER J-FLASH Lite(V6.22 or higher):

   a. Open SEGGER J-FLASH Lite, select device LPC54S018M.

   b. Click the 'Erase Chip' to erase the extrenal flash.(if can not success, press SW4 button and reset the board, and try to erase again)

   c. Select the bin data file, set the '.bin/Erase Start' address to 0x10000000, then click 'Program Device'
Note: Please use above way to program the binary file built by armgcc tool chain to external flash. 
      For IAR, KEIL, MCUXpresso IDE, you can use the IDE tool to program the external flash.  
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
